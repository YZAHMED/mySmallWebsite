# My First Website

Welcome to my small website! This is a basic web project I created to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is my first project, so it's not perfect! I'm still learning and improving my skills. 😃

## 🖥️ Code Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## 📌 How to Run
